# publish-or-perish
A devcontainer for writing and publishing articles

## Backstory

I've decided there are 3 Pillars of Walter: Learning, Programming, and Writing. This repository is all about facilitating the Writing pillar (and, come to think of it, will incorporate the other two pillars as well).

## Expected Outcomes

The repo will house a devcontainer that will:
* mount two other repos; one private repo for drafts and one public repo for published articles.
* have a mechanism that copies articles from one repo to the other and does some git related stuff.

**more to come**
